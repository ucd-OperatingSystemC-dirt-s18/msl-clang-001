## About:

This program will read in a file with English words and output a file where the words are counted and alphabetically sorted. The process is involves important features of the C language(pointers, dynamic memory allocation with `malloc` and deallocation with `free`, `struct` data structures).  The fundamental data structure is a Binary Tree. 

### Usage:
`./<executable> <input_filename> <output_filename>`
